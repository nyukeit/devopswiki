# Welcome to DevOps Wiki

## Disclaimer

These are my personal notes that I create while learning DevOps. These are NOT intended for use in production environments. The notes may or may not be updated for the latest changes in various DevOps tools. They are only intended to be correct at the time of writing, even though I try hard to keep them current as far as possible.

I find this to be the easiest method to carry notes around instead of using bulky note taking tools. If you find value out of these and wish to contribute in any manner, do read the CONTRIBUTING. I welcome any and all types of contributions.
